        <h1 id="RA-title" class="p-10 text-5xl">Oxyana: The Tragedy of Rural Appalachia</h1>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Oxyana is a documentary film released in 2013 by Sean Dunne. In this film, Sean Dunne goes into detail about the ongoing opioid epidemic in the town of Oceana, West Virginia, and the surrounding Wyoming County. Oceana used to be a thriving, coal-mining town with great views and great people. While the views and the people remained, the economic prosperity did leave with the closure of the mines. Those closures had a devastating effect on the economic health of Oceana, resulting in an ongoing opioid epidemic. In Oceana, Sean Dunne is arguing that the town of Oceana is experiencing a devastating opioid epidemic, that is destroying both the town and its residents. If nothing is done about it, Oceana will eventually cease to exist.
        </p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Oxyana relies heavily on visual and auditory rhetorical devices to tell its story. Imagery is an important part of the film’s argument. One of the main uses of imagery in Oxyana is shown during the interviews, which take up most of the runtime of the film. During the interviews, the camera does point at the interviewee, however, the person interviewed is not in the center of the shot. Instead, the interviewee is located at the edge of the camera angle, shifting visual focus onto the image behind them. Such a choice in camera angle serves multiple purposes. In some examples, it is meant to show the beauty of Oceana and provide a positive outlook on the town, showing to the audience that there is some good in Oceana and it is not defined just by its ongoing epidemic. Another use of camera angle is meant to show the daily lives of Oceana residents. Such camera angle shows the struggle of living in Oceana. Since the closure of the coal mines, it has become increasingly difficult to provide a livable income through legal means. The opioid epidemic, which resulted from the operating coal mines, provides the residents with means to support themselves and their families, although illegally. The imagery of the lives of Oceana residents shows that many of them have little choice but to contribute to the opioid epidemic by selling drugs, thus justifying, in a way, their actions.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Sean Dunne is extremely conservative in sound usage in the film. In fact, music is only used three times in Oxyana, one of those being the end credits. Such limited sound usage allows the audience to focus more on the imagery and the interviews, which further highlights the significance of those devices in the film.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">In conclusion, Oxyana uses minimal rhetorical devices, or in some cases lack of thereof, in order to argue its message with great success. By relying on rhetorical devices that do not interrupt the message sent through the interviews, Sean Dunne does an amazing job at focusing the audience’s attention on the stories of Oceana’s residents, which shows the gravity of the problem the town is facing.</p>

        <h1 class="p-10 text-5xl">Dear Senator Tillis,</h1>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">As a constituent, I urge you to increase your support towards bill H.R.4818, which would assist with creating and expanding service-learning programs aimed at tackling the childhood obesity pandemic, that has plagued our beautiful country. A great example of a successful service-learning program is S.O.C.C.E.R. (Stopping Childhood Obesity in Children through Creative Education and Reinforcement).</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Childhood obesity rates have significantly increased over the past few decades, posing serious long-term health risks to our youth, including increased likelihood of developing diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. This not only impacts individual well-being but also places a substantial burden on our healthcare system. Fortunately, childhood obesity is largely preventable through interventions that promote healthy eating and physical activity.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">The S.O.C.C.E.R. program model, implemented successfully in neighboring Tennessee, demonstrates a powerful approach. By combining physical activity, such as soccer clinics, with nutrition education, it effectively promotes healthy lifestyle habits among children. Key elements of this successful model included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lg font-extrabold">Engaging Activities: Soccer clinics focused on skills and scrimmages combined with interactive healthy eating lessons.</li>
          <li class="lg font-extrabold">Community Partnership: Collaboration between university students (acting as volunteer mentors) and community organizations like the Boys and Girls Club.</li>
          <li class="lg font-extrabold">Positive Outcomes: Demonstrated improvement in children's knowledge about healthy eating and provided valuable mentorship opportunities. It also helped young adult volunteers develop leadership skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Investing in such programs in rural North Carolina could provide similar benefits, offering children structured physical activity, vital health education, and positive mentorship. These initiatives not only combat childhood obesity but also foster community engagement and support the development of our youth.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">I believe that bill H.R.4818 will assist with allocating increased state and federal resources to establish and sustain programs modeled after initiatives like S.O.C.C.E.R. It represents a valuable investment in the long-term health and future of North Carolina's communities.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Thank you for your time, consideration, and continued service to the state of North Carolina. I hope you will champion increased support for these vital youth health programs.</p>
        <h3 class="lg font-extrabold">Sincerely,</h3>

        <h1 class="p-10 text-3xl">Writer's Memo</h1>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">As I was starting my work on the Scholarly Article Translation Project, my intentions were simple. I wanted to create a PowerPoint, throw some data from the article itself on it, record a voice over, and call it a day. However, that drastically changed during the annotation part of the project. Reading the accounts and testimonies of all of the participants of the program, both volunteers and the children, inspired me greatly. Seeing such an overall positive experience in a program aimed at tackling one of, if not, the greatest issues in the United States at the moment, I simply could not allow myself to settle on such a low-effort medium of translation. Of course, I could have made a great presentation, perhaps worthy of a TedTalk. However, I no longer found such a format sufficient for this project. That left me without a plan of action, and I started thinking. What would be a great way to translate this article, leading to a positive change? Fortunately, around that time period I stumbled upon the end of the Post-Program Reflection section, which mentioned the lack of funding experienced by the program. As far as I know, it is our representatives that are responsible for the allocation of financial resources in this country, therefore I decided to strike at that.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">When it comes to the format of my translation, the choice was simple. A letter is an official way to reach out to a representative, which would qualify for this project. However, as I quickly realized, writing a small letter on such a topic is no simple task. I had to condense and simplify pages upon pages of data into a tiny letter. Quickly I realized that a simple wall of text would not suffice, so I had to think outside the box. Upon looking at multiple templates for a letter to a congressman, I found bullet points to be a common practice, so I decided to use that. While that did further limit the space available in a format that already calls for a limited space usage, I was able to pinpoint to the main argument of my letter: service-learning programs are an effective way to address the childhood obesity problem, which provide plenty of other benefits to the community, thus bettering the lives of Americans, both rural and urban.</p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">While I am satisfied with the writing in my Scholarly Analysis Translation Project, the formatting definitely needs improvements in my opinion. I was surprised at my ability to condense such an article into such a small format. Usually, my writing tends to be long and drawn out, which I have to put a lot of time and effort into trimming. However, that was not the case with this project. Maybe, the scientific basis of this article helped me to condense it into such a packed format. Or, perhaps, my writing skills have improved during the semester, which I find hard to believe. As for formatting, I definitely want to make that letter look more presentable, perhaps even add some graphic design elements to it to make it appealing to the senator. Hopefully, during the summer I am able to work on that and actually send it to senator Tillis.</p>

        <h1 class="p-10 text-5xl">Researching the Digital Divide in Rural America</h1>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Connecting computer science and rural America is an extremely challenging task. The last thing you think about when it comes to computer science is rural America. In fact, even coming up with an appropriate research question was not easy. Fortunately, after some thinking, I realized that I could look into why there is so little connection between computer science and rural America and base my research question on that. Very quickly, the term "digital divide" came up in my research, and I knew that this is exactly what I wanted to research for this essay. At first, I wanted to base my research question on whether the digital divide exists in the first place, but I quickly realized that was not challenging enough. All of the academic articles written on the digital divide simply assume that the digital divide exists and focus on the scale of its effects. That made me alter the research question accordingly. Instead of researching about the existence of the digital divide, I decided to research the scale of its effect on rural America.
        </p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Once I decided on the research question, I started a deep dive into relevant articles about the digital divide. I expected to come out empty handed, since when I was trying to formulate my research question, I could find little relevant articles. To my surprise, once I fine-tuned my search entries, I managed to find plenty of academic material written on the rural digital divide. To my additional surprise, most of the articles were not relevant to my research question, since they were written about other countries. In fact, most of the articles I encountered at first were specifically focused on Southeast Asia, in particular India, South Korea, and Indonesia. Unfortunately, once I clarified to JSTOR that I am interested in papers written about the United States, I could not find any relevant articles. That is when I remembered about the existence of AI. Surely, it is not considered cheating if I do not use AI to write the paper for me, but to look for relevant research? Unfortunately, AI was not too helpful with providing relevant material. Most of the articles it listed simply did not exist or were not relevant to my research question. What the AI did, however, is provide the names of academics writing those articles. By searching by name on JSTOR, I was able to find the sources relevant to my research.
        </p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">Another problem I encountered during my research was the researchers themselves. That was to be expected, but not to the extent that I have found. Most, if not all of the research that is relevant to my topic that I did not include as a potential source was written by white men. The AI helped alleviate some of those struggles, but at some point, it just kept repeating the articles and people it was showing to me, and I had to rely on my own searching in order to find a sufficient amount of sources for my research. I mainly relied on JSTOR, as I have the most experience with it and it is a solid and reliable academic database, filled with many high-level sources. I tried, at some point, to use Google Scholar to find the material the AI kept mentioning, but it proved to be unreliable, showing me a bunch of unrelated articles that had nothing to do with my research.
        </p>
        <p class="lg font-extrabold">At the end of the day, my research process for this paper has proven to be quite a challenge, but I challenge that I enjoyed taking on. It was not easy to find the sources relevant to my research, but through hard work, determination, and thinking outside the box, I was able to find many publications that fit the criteria for my paper. Additionally, I was able to find many underrepresented voices in the field of computer science, which showed me, that despite there being an overwhelming majority of white men in our field, there are many outstanding individuals that do not identify as such pushing forward the field of computer science to a greater tomorrow.

        <h1 id="RA-title" class="p-10 text-5xl">Thesis Statement</h1>
        <p class="px-50 lg font-extrabold">This digital art project, presented as an interactive website, employs a stark juxtaposition of visual aesthetics and user experience to confront the viewer with the often-hidden, harsh realities of contemporary Appalachian life, drawing specific inspiration from the harrowing narratives depicted in films like "Oxyana" and "Harlan County, USA." The website functions as a deliberate aesthetic deception: its initial navigation pathways—the homepage and introductory sections—are rendered in the disarming style of children's drawings, utilizing bright, playful colors, simple lines, and naive iconography. This visual strategy is designed intentionally to evoke feelings of nostalgia, innocence, ease, and calm, luring the user into a state of lowered guard and superficial comfort, mirroring perhaps a romanticized or willfully ignorant external perception of the Appalachian region as merely quaint or simple.</p>
        <p class="px-50 lg font-extrabold">The core of the project, however, resides on a specific, designated page that shatters this carefully constructed facade. Upon navigating to this central "art piece" page, the user is abruptly confronted with a radically different visual and emotional landscape. The childlike simplicity vanishes, replaced by a jarring, visceral aesthetic dominated by imagery of violence, despair, and addiction—specifically guns, knives, and hypodermic needles. The color palette shifts dramatically to overwhelming, aggressive reds and dark, unsettling tones, creating an atmosphere of immediate threat, fear, and distress. This stark contrast is not merely for shock value; it serves as the central metaphor of the work. The comforting exterior represents the surface-level view or stereotype, while the disturbing interior reveals the painful, complex truths—systemic poverty, the opioid epidemic, cycles of violence, lack of opportunity, and profound suffering—that documentaries like "Oxyana" (exploring the opioid crisis's devastation) and "Harlan County, USA" (highlighting entrenched poverty and struggle) unflinchingly portray.</p>
        <p class="px-50 lg font-extrabold">The choice of a website as the medium is crucial. The interactive nature requires the viewer to actively navigate from the "safe," childlike spaces into the "dangerous," confrontational core. This journey mimics the process of uncovering uncomfortable truths, forcing a participatory engagement rather than passive observation. The user's own clicks lead them from manufactured innocence to raw, unpleasant reality, implicating them in the revelation and breaking down the comfortable distance often maintained from such difficult subjects.</p>
        <p class="px-50 lg font-extrabold">Ultimately, this webpage utilizes the deceptive potential of visual language and the interactive pathway of a website to function as a piece of social commentary. It challenges viewers' preconceived notions and complacency regarding the Appalachian region, leveraging the initial dissonance between the playful exterior and the brutal interior to provoke critical reflection on the unseen struggles and silenced narratives within communities often reduced to stereotypes. The work aims to disrupt comfort, stimulate dialogue, and foster a deeper, more complex understanding of the dark side of Appalachian life that persists beneath surfaces, much like the disturbing truths exposed in its cinematic inspirations. It is an attempt to make the unseen seen, using the language of digital art to bridge the gap between perception and reality.</p>
